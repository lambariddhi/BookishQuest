# BookishQuest

This project was created by Riddhi Lamba and Luna Lee. It is a website for logging books, including being able to mark lists of currently reading and recently read books, favorite books, and leave ratings and reviews. It is coded using HTML, CSS, and Javascript on the front end and uses SQL for the back-end database work.

You can watch a demo of the project on the "BookishQuest.mp4" and see the main code files in the "BookishQuest" folder.
